This repo only conatins code I have written from online classes or other resources. Since I may or may not try my hand with many languages/courses, I thought keeping all my self-taught code in a single repo was the best idea.

Here I also get to practice some markdown syntax and formatting.
Dear future, please view this README.md to check on how to write in markdown.

And as **imagination** bodies forth,
The forms of things *unknown*, the poet's pen,
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing,
A local *habitation* and a **name**.
